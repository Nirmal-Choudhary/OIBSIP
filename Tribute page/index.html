            <p class="textp">
              Born Narendranath Datta, Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 - 4
              July 1902) was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, writer, and
              religious teacher. He was also Ramakrishna`s most important pupil.
              Swami Vivekananda is credited with promoting interfaith
              understanding and elevating Hinduism to the position of a
              significant international religion. Swami Vivekananda was a vital
              player in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western
              world.
            </p>
            <p class="textp">
              After delivering his well-known address at the 1893 Parliament of
              Religions in Chicago and introducing Hinduism to Americans with
              the words “Sisters and brothers of America,” Vivekananda gained
              popularity. Swami Vivekananda made such an effect at the
              Parliament that he was called “an orator by divine right and
              unquestionably the greatest figure at the Parliament” by an
              American publication. After having great success at the
              Parliament, Vivekananda continued to spread the fundamental
              principles of Hindu philosophy by giving hundreds of lectures
              across the United States, England, and Europe. Swami Vivekananda
              also founded the Vedanta Societies of New York and San Francisco
              (now known as the Vedanta Society of Northern California), which
              served as the cornerstones for Vedanta Societies in the West....

            <h2>Swami Vivekananda Birth and Early Life</h2>
            <p class="pm">
              On January 12, 1863, during the Makar Sankranti festival, Swami
              Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta into a Bengali family
              in his ancestral house at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in
              Calcutta, the capital of British India. Swami Vivekananda was one
              of nine siblings and came from a conventional family. Vishwanath
              Datta, his father, worked as a lawyer at the Calcutta High Court.
              Sanskrit and Persian scholar Durgacharan Datta, Narendra’s
              grandfather, abandoned his family at age 25 to become a monk.
              Bhubaneswari Devi, Swami Vivekananda’s mother, was a devoted
              housewife. Narendra’s father had a progressive, logical outlook,
              while his mother had a devout temperament, both of which
              influenced his way of thinking and personality

            <h2>Swami Vivekananda Education</h2>
            <p class="pm">
              At the age of eight, Swami Vivekananda joined at the Metropolitan
              Institution of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, where he attended school
              until his family relocated to Raipur in 1877. Swami Vivekananda
              was the sole student to achieve first-division marks on the
              Presidency College admission exam in 1879, following the
              relocation of his family to Calcutta. At the General Assembly’s
              Institution, Swami Vivekananda studied Western logic, Western
              philosophy, and European history (now known as the Scottish Church
              College). Swami Vivekananda passed the Fine Arts test in 1881, and
              in 1884 he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree.

            <h2>Swami Vivekananda Death and Later Life</h2>
            <p class="pm">
              On July 4th, 1902, Swami Vivekananda rose early, travelled to the
              monastery at Belur Math, and engaged in a three-hour meditation
              session. Swami Vivekananda lectured students on the
              Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar, and the yoga philosophy
              before holding a meeting with colleagues to propose a future Vedic
              college at the Ramakrishna Math. Swami Vivekananda went to his
              room at 7:00 p.m. and asked that no one bother him; he passed away
              at 9:20 p.m. while meditating. Swami Vivekananda experienced
              mahasamadhi, according to his followers; a blood vessel burst in
              his brain was suggested as a potential cause of death. Swami
              Vivekananda’s followers said the rupture was brought on by the
              piercing of his brahmarandhra during mahasamadhi.

            All that man has to do is to take care of three things; good
            thought, good word, good deed.
